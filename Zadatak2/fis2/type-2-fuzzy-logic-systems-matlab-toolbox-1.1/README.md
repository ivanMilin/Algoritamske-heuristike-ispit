# Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System Toolbox
A Matlab/Simulink Library for the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2-FLS). The presented toolbox is presented in the following paper:

      Taskin, A. and Kumbasar, T., 2015. An open source Matlab/Simulink Toolbox for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems, IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence – SSCI 2015, Cape Town, South Africa. (draft version –final version)

We kindly ask that to cite the above mentioned paper if you use IT2-FLS Matlab/Simulink Toolbox and you publish papers about work that was performed using IT2-FLS Matlab/Simulink Toolbox.

# How to run IT2-FLS Toolbox
Download or clone the repository into a convenient directory.
Open MATLAB 2015a or a newer version.
Then run "fuzzyt2.m" which locates at the root of project.

# How to run examples in the repository

The repositort includes 2 examples. First one is and edge detection of an image, the secon one is an control example by using an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic controller.

To run first example (Edge detection)
- go to 'it2-fls-toolbox\Examples\3_1_MatlabAppicationExample' directory
- run the 'runEdgeDetectionExample.m' m script.

To run second example (control system)
- go to 'it2-fls-toolbox\Examples\3_2_ControlSystemsExample' directory
- run the 'runControlSystemExample.m' m script.
